# Term-2048

## About

> [!IMPORTANT] Important
> Please note that this project is not currently in a playable state yet.

**Term-2048** is a game of 2048 that runs in the terminal, implemented in pure Haskell.

This project serves to be somewhat of a development playground. While playability is a goal of this project, the ultimate goal of this project is for me to implement a working program in the functional style, and to be able to exercise best practices where I can.

Furthermore, I aim to be able to document the practices I apply to this project through in-code documentation and explanatory markdown files.

I hope to come back periodically to this project to possibly implement new features where applicable, and to fine-tune the code used to implement the game with updated practices as I continue to work within the functional style.
